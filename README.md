## Overview

This repo is a step-by-step journey through the mysteries of the modern JavaScript environment. Each directory in the repo is a self-contained JavaScript project designed and configured to illustrate some (very) specific concept in modern JavaScript development. Each project's README is essentially a commit message describing how the project worked (or was broken) on commit X and why it worked (or was broken) on commit X+1.

## Motivation

For the first couple years after I wrote my literal first line of code, computer programming continued to remain to me a deeply arcane practice. I could build and deploy a React app and web server to AWS, I could use a debugger, and I kinda sorta understood processes and memory and whatever. But I didn't _really_ have any idea what was going on.

For me the magic faded like a step function, a series of "aha!" moments triggered by some _very specific_ detail that had just, for whatever reason, never been made explicit to me. Some of the examples in this project may seem trivial, but I think it's extremely hard to predict what random details may have slipped through the crack. I also believe that I'll find a few "trivial" concepts that I thought I understood but actually was completely mistaken about.

_Side thought: it's kind of like [codepen](https://codepen.io) but for the underlying programming environment rather than application code._

## Index

_In the long run I plan to include in this index references to other projects that follow the same kind of `concept -> broken commit -> fixed commit -> README` format._
